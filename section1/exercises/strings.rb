songline = "I bomb atomically. Socrates philosophies and hypotheses can't define how I be droppin these mockeries, lyrically perform armed robbery. Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me. Battle-scarred Shogun, explosion when my pen hits tremendous. Ultraviolet shine blind forensics. I inspect you through the future see millennium. Killa Beez sold fifty gold, sixty platinum, shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics. Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths. Black Wu jackets, Queen Beez ease the guns in. Rumble with patrolmen, tear gas laced the function. Heads by the score take flight, incite a war. Chicks hit the floor, diehard fans demand more. Behold the bold soldier, control the glob slowly. Proceeds to blow, swinging swords like Shinobi. Stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock. Wu got it locked, performing live on your hottest block"
