## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
- The article was short and to the point. Nothing in it was a huge revelation to me, but it's helpful to be reminded of some of the things that I should pay attention to.
- I used to be a teacher, so habit number 4 definitely makes sense and I've been practicing it when I can with my classmates.
- Habit 1 about reading is something I'd like to do more of, but finding the time is always a challenge!

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
- If you want to include the double quotes, then you can use `p "Hello World!"`.
- If you want it to print without the double quotes around it, then use the `puts` command instead of `p`.

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
- The `#` symbol, know as the pound sign, hash sign, or octothorpe, is used to comment out lines that should not be read and processed as code.

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
- Integers are whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or zero.
- Float numbers are expressed as a decimal, such as 3.14159 or -7.00.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
- `animal = "zebra"`

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
- `puts animal`

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
- Interpolation is when a variable is inserted into a string.
- `puts "It has been said that a #{animal} looks like a horse with stripes."`

1. What method is used to get input from a user?
- `gets.chomp`
1. Name and describe two common string methods:
- `Concatenation` combines multiple strings using a `+` sign.
- `Interpolation` substitutes one string in for a variable inside of a second string, as described above.
- `____.length` will give the character count of a string.
- `____.split` can be used to break a string into smaller parts, either wherever a space occurs or any other character, like a comma for example.
- `____.sub` and `____.gsub` can be used to find and replace part of a string with something else.
